### Connect Four AI

This was a project I completed for my CIS120 class. It implements the game of Connect Four along with several Monte Carlo tree search-based algorithms to play the game against the user.
The best performing algorithm used a simple heuristic function that scores the position based on the number of tiles near the center of the board that each player has.
These algorithms also write all the positions they have solved to a cache when the playing window is closed.
